/**
 * I choose to define a LAZY Fetch Type, since it doesn't add much value to the end user to retrieve
 * all associated lists as a response to their HTTP requests, as well as it would increase the complexity
 * of the stream().map() methods we perform in the @Controller layer, which doesn't pay off.
 *
 * Moreover, I define an ALL Cascade Type, in order to when it comes to make changes to the entities,
 * we can do that at once, avoiding several "persist" or "remove" operations to, for instance,
 * change the name of the pet because a misspelling.
